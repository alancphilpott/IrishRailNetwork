# Train Ticketing System - C# Software Project

The system provides station management. The primary actor can add a new station, close a station and list all stations. The system will provide route management being able to add a route, terminate a route and list all routes. A train schedule for a route can be created along with being able to view a train timetable of all scheduled trains. The system provides a function in relation to tickets. The system will firstly allow you to create/set ticket types e.g. Adult Single. If any new  types should need to be added a function called Update Ticket Type will allow such updating. A ticket can then be sold in relation to the customerâ€™s requests. The system will finally provide a function to view revenue analysis and ticket sales analysis, meaning you can view the gross amount of money being made and the what is the most frequent selling ticket type.
